                        I just recently got something very interesting in the
                        mail. This is something that I had ordered a couple
                        months back and I really wasn't expecting to ever get
                        it. This item is the VoCore2 Lite.

                        This tiny little board is capable of a lot more than you
                        would think. The SoC is MediaTek's MT7688AN. This SoC is
                        designed for use in wireless routers, so it has built in
                        wireless capabilities as well as a built in ethernet
                        switch. The system has 64MB of RAM and 8MB of built in
                        NOR flash storage. The storage can be expanded by adding
                        a SD card. The board also has GPIO that can be used to
                        control other devices. I plan to use a relay to control
                        a light remotely. The Vocore2 Lite will also serve me as
                        a great portable wireless router; or maybe I will have
                        it host a website in the future.

                        I am excited to get working with this new tool, but I
                        first have to wait for the tools I need in order to
                        wire up the system without potential damage. I will post
                        again once I get something working. In the meantime, I
                        am going to be working on making the PDF on this website
                        inserted using pdf.js instead of just using a simple
                        HTML object. This will allow for more browsers to be
                        able to display the document.

                    <p>This is my first blog post. The goal of this blog is
                        to help me grow more familiar with using HTML and CSS
                        with the Twitter Bootstrap. I want to become more fluent
                        in web design so that I can use this skill in the
                        future.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>In the future, I may write more posts on this blog
                        discussing topics that I am learning in school. This
                        will help me gain a better understanding of these topics
                        as I will be thinking about them in greater detail.</p>
