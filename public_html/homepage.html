                            <a href="#">Logan</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I just recently got another small prototyping
                            computer called the
                            <a href="https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/omega2p.html">
                                Onion Omega2+
                            </a>. This computer comes in a convenient package
                            that allows you to use many different docks that
                            allow you to connect to different peripherals. I got
                            the breadboard dock with mine. The breadboard dock
                            makes prototyping with the Onion Omega much easier.
                            There is no soldering required and components can be
                            swapped around quickly. The Onion Omega has 15 GPIOs
                            that can be used to attach a great number of
                            different input and output devices. Some of the pins
                            even have built in serial communication abilities,
                            which allow for an even greater number of components
                            to be connected through multiplexing. The Onion
                            Omega also supports I<sup>2</sup>C and SPI devices
                            like those that commonly drive simple displays. The
                            first project I have planned for my Omega involves
                            using I<sup>2</sup>C to connect either 7 segment
                            displays or some type of OLED display in order to
                            create an alarm clock.

                        <p>
                            The Onion Omega2+ runs on a similar chipset to the
                            <a href="#voco">VoCore</a>, but comes in a package
                            that is much easier to deal with. The Omega runs a
                            distribution of Linux that is based on
                            <a href="https://lede-project.org/">LEDE</a>. This
                            allows for the computer to be very capable, even
                            though the device has no way of producing a useful
                            graphical environment. In order to make the Omega
                            easy to use, there is a web interface to the device
                            that can be accessed through any web browser. This
                            web interface is surprisingly complete and almost
                            feels like the experience you would expect from a
                            graphical shell such as Ubuntu's Unity. However, I
                            prefer the simplicity of using the command line,
                            which can easily be done using ssh or by using
                            serial communication. I can tell that this device
                            will prove to be very useful to me in the future
                            even if just as a wireless access point; and I am
                            excited to see what interesting projects I can think
                            of to make use of the device.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With the new developments around Mozilla's Rust
                            programming language and Redox OS, I thought that it
                            would be interesting to talk about the future of
                            kernel architecture. In the past, the future looked
                            as though th microkernel approach would prove to be
                            the system of choice as computers began connecting
                            through the internet and could potentially harm your
                            computer. Monolithic kernels we use today such as
                            the Linux kernel could be considered insecure in
                            respect to the way all programs are run in
                            "Supervisor Mode". This means that every piece of
                            the operating system is allowed direct access to the
                            hardware. Many people that prefer to work in Linux
                            explain their reason for using Linux to be that
                            Linux is more secure than Microsoft Windows. The
                            Windows NT kernel is structured as what is known as
                            a hybrid kernel. This means that the kernel is
                            structured like a microkernel, but still runs most
                            of the OS in kernel space. This means that the
                            hybrid Windows NT kernel might even be more secure
                            than the Linux kernel. Apple's Darwin originally
                            started as slight modifications to the Mach
                            microkernel. Over time, Apple has made the kernel
                            into a hybrid kernel operating in a similar way to
                            the NT kernel.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are still many remnants of the old
                            microkernels that were used for research purposes.
                            One example is the Minix kernel. The linux kernel
                            was actually based on this system. Minux is not so
                            useable today because it does not support a 64-bit
                            environment. This is problematic because it limits
                            the amount of memory the system can address. Another
                            microkernel that has the same issues is GNU Hurd.
                            This kernel is where the GNU utilities we often find
                            with other Unix based systems were originally
                            planned for. HelenOS is another microkernel based
                            operating system that is used for research purposes.
                            HelenOS does not suffer from the lack of support for
                            hardware. However, has sacrificed compatibility with
                            the majority of the software written for Unix
                            systems. The newest addition to the list of
                            microkernel systems is Redox OS. Redox brings all
                            the benefits of the microkernel to modern systems
                            while using a modern Unix-like interface. What makes
                            Redox even more special is that it is written mostly
                            in Rust. Rust is a programming language similar to
                            C++, but is memory safe. The combination of Rust and
                            the microkernel architecture will possibly make
                            Redox the most stable operating system there is. We
                            will just have to wait and see where this project
                            takes us.

                        I just recently got something very interesting in the
                        mail. This is something that I had ordered a couple
                        months back and I really wasn't expecting to ever get
                        it. This item is the VoCore2 Lite.

                        This tiny little board is capable of a lot more than you
                        would think. The SoC is MediaTek's MT7688AN. This SoC is
                        designed for use in wireless routers, so it has built in
                        wireless capabilities as well as a built in ethernet
                        switch. The system has 64MB of RAM and 8MB of built in
                        NOR flash storage. The storage can be expanded by adding
                        a SD card. The board also has GPIO that can be used to
                        control other devices. I plan to use a relay to control
                        a light remotely. The Vocore2 Lite will also serve me as
                        a great portable wireless router; or maybe I will have
                        it host a website in the future.

                        I am excited to get working with this new tool, but I
                        first have to wait for the tools I need in order to
                        wire up the system without potential damage. I will post
                        again once I get something working. In the meantime, I
                        am going to be working on making the PDF on this website
                        inserted using pdf.js instead of just using a simple
                        HTML object. This will allow for more browsers to be
                        able to display the document.
